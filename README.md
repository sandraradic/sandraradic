(she/her)

I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying Computational Intelligence & Design at UBC, who is passionate about technology, particularly from the perspective of computer and brain intelligence. I've recently also taken on a minor in Data Science! 

I am currently mostly working on programs in Python, and learning data visualization methods using Altair.
